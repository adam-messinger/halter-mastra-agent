## Farm System

- What is the primary goal of my dairy system: profit per hectare, profit per cow, or lifestyle and workload balance?
- Should my farm run as all-grass, grass plus supplements, or a higher-input system given my soils and climate?
- What stocking rate can my farm realistically carry in an average season without buying excessive feed?
- How does my optimal stocking rate change in a wet year, a dry year, or under irrigation?
- Am I better off running more moderate cows at higher stocking rate, or fewer high-producing cows with more inputs?
- What is my realistic target for milksolids per hectare and per cow in this district?
- Is my current calving pattern (spring/autumn/split) still the best fit for my milk contract and pasture growth curve?
- How dependent is my system on purchased feed, and am I comfortable with that exposure to price and supply shocks?
- What are the biggest constraints on production on this farm: pasture growth, cow condition, labour, shed capacity, or cash?
- If I changed nothing else, which single constraint would unlock the most extra profit or resilience?

## Genetics and Breeding

- What is the ideal cow type for this farm: Friesian, Jersey, crossbred, or another mix, given my pasture and payout structure?
- Are my cows too big and high-maintenance for a largely grass-based system, or too small to take advantage of my feed supply?
- How much emphasis should I put on fertility vs production vs longevity in breeding decisions?
- Am I using BW, PW, and reliability figures effectively when selecting bulls and replacements?
- How much inbreeding risk do I have in the herd, and how am I managing it?
- Should I be using more sexed semen, beef semen, or both to improve herd genetics and calf value?
- Are my top cows truly my top profit cows, or just my highest-volume producers?
- What physical faults (feet, udders, temperament) are costing me most in lost milk and culling?
- Am I better to breed for slightly less peak production but better fertility and robustness under pasture-only feeding?
- How should I balance using AI sires vs natural bulls to hit my breeding and workload goals?

## Pasture Management

- What does my pasture growth curve actually look like month by month, not just what I assume?
- How accurate is my pasture measurement (plate meter, eyeballing, software) and do I use that data for decisions?
- What is my true average pasture utilisation: how much grown vs how much eaten or wasted?
- Am I carrying too much pasture into spring or too little into summer and autumn?
- Do I have clear target pre-graze and post-graze covers for each time of the season?
- How often do my actual residuals match those targets, and what stops me when they do not?
- Is my regrassing programme fast enough to keep the proportion of young, productive pasture high?
- Are my pasture species (ryegrass, clover, herbs) still the best fit for my soils and climate trends?
- Would alternative forages (fodder beet, lucerne, kale, plantain mixes) improve my feed supply or just add complexity?

- How quickly do I adjust rotation length in response to changes in growth rate and forecast?
- Am I using on-off grazing, back-fencing, or other tools to protect pasture in wet conditions?
- Where are my worst-performing paddocks, and do I know exactly why they underperform (drainage, fertility, species, aspect)?
- Is soil fertility (pH, P, K, S, trace elements) limiting pasture growth, and do I have recent soil tests?
- How efficiently am I using nitrogen: timing, rate, and placement versus leaching and waste?
- Could better pasture management reduce my reliance on bought-in feed by a meaningful amount?
- Do I know the real cost per tonne of DM of my home-grown pasture versus purchased feeds?
- Are my laneways, water troughs, and paddock layouts helping or hindering even pasture utilisation?
- Am I leaving enough residual leaf area to maintain pasture quality and persistence over years?

## Reproduction

- What is my current 6-week in-calf rate, and what is realistically achievable on this farm?
- How many days after calving are cows typically cycling and ready to mate?
- Are my cows going to mating with an adequate body condition score to conceive early?
- Is my mating period too long, causing a drawn-out calving and extra labour, or too short for my current management?
- How effectively am I detecting heats: visual observation, tail paint, activity monitors, or a mix?
- Do I have a clear plan for anoestrous cows before and during mating (metrics, interventions, vet input)?
- What proportion of herd is mated in the first 3 weeks, and how does that affect my calving profile and production?
- Should I use synchrony programmes in heifers or cows to tighten mating and calving, and does the economics stack up?
- What is my empty rate and what are the key drivers: nutrition, genetics, disease, or mating management?
- How am I using mating and culling decisions to steadily improve herd fertility over several seasons?

## Calving

- Is my planned start of calving aligned with when I will have enough cheap feed for freshly calved cows?
- Are cows at target condition score at drying off and at calving, and how often do I check this objectively?
- How well am I managing the transition period from dry cow to early lactation to minimise metabolic disease?
- Do I have clear protocols for down cows, milk fever, ketosis, and other peripartum issues?
- Is my calving area set up to minimise stress, mud, and disease pressure for cows and calves?

- Do I intervene too early or too late in difficult calvings, based on vet guidance?
- How am I ensuring newborn calves get adequate, good-quality colostrum quickly after birth?
- What is my actual calf mortality from birth to weaning, and what are the main causes?
- Could changing calving date, cow genetics, or body condition materially reduce calving problems?

## Replacements and Youngstock

- How many replacements do I actually need given my cull rate and expansion or contraction plans?
- Am I rearing too many or too few heifers relative to the herd I want in 3–5 years?
- What are my criteria for selecting heifer calves: genetics, dam performance, birth date, health?
- Is my colostrum management for replacement calves good enough to protect future herd health and longevity?
- Are rearing facilities (pens, hutches, sheds) giving calves a clean, dry, well-ventilated environment?
- What growth targets do I have for calves and yearlings, and do I measure if they are being hit?
- Are my youngstock grazing and parasite programmes setting them up to calve at the right size and age?
- Should I contract graze heifers or rear them on-farm, and which option gives better long-term results?
- Are my heifers entering the herd in good condition and calving early, or always playing catch-up?
- How do I cull or reclassify poor-performing young cows quickly enough to avoid dragging the herd down?

## Herd Health

- What are the main health issues in my herd: lameness, mastitis, metabolic disease, reproduction, parasites, or others?
- Is my herd health plan genuinely preventative or mostly reactive to problems as they arise?
- Do I have an agreed annual animal health plan with my vet that includes targets and review points?

- Does the shed layout, yard size, and backing gate operation minimise cow stress and slipping?
- Is shed and effluent infrastructure adequate for the current herd size and any planned growth?
- Could automations (cup removers, drafting, activity collars) pay their way in labour savings or better decisions?
- How could I reduce time per milking while maintaining or improving milk quality and animal welfare?

## Environment and Compliance

## Labour and Finance

- Is my labour setup sustainable: hours, rosters, housing, and training for me, family, and staff?
- Which tasks could be systematised or delegated to reduce reliance on a few key people?
- What financial metrics do I track regularly (for example, EBIT per hectare, cost of production per kg MS) to guide decisions?
